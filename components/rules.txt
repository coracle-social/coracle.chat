General Rule for Cross-Platform Centering (Vertical & Horizontal) in Absolute Layouts
Avoid using percentage-based positioning (top: '50%', left: '50%') with transforms (translateX/Y) for centering.
Instead, prefer using top: 0, bottom: 0, left: 0, right: 0 with marginVertical: 'auto' and marginHorizontal: 'auto' to achieve consistent centering across both React Native and Web.

Avoid hardcoded width or height in favor of minimum values and padding/margin to define size
